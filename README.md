# FirstKeylogger
This simple keylogger was developed by me FOR PRACTICAL USE ONLY.This was not created for malicious purposes.

STEP ONE:
        In cmd enter pip install -r requirments.txt
        

STEP TWO:
        Go to the "Keylogger" dir and inside of "Keylogger.py"
        
        edit EMAIL_ADDRESS = "[ENTER YOUR EMAIL HERE]" && EMAIL_PASSWORD = "[ENTER YOUR PASSWORD HERE]" 


STEP THREE:        
        In cmd enter python setup.py build


STEP FOUR:
        Enjoy the logger. While the application is running the email you entered will feed you the information.
